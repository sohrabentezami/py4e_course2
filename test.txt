Hikes

1. Take a Drive up the Sea-to-Sky Highway
* Horseshoe bay
* Porteau Cove Provincial Park: Beautiful beach
* Murrin Provincial Park: At only 2km in length, the Murrin Park Loop Trail is one of the quickest hikes in Squamish, and it makes no compromise on views.
Murrin offers two main trails in the park. The Browning Lake Trail which meanders around the lake and surrounding forest and the relatively new Murrin Park Loop Trail (also called the Quercus Trail) which dips into the forest giving you a tour of the entire park. Plan for the trail to take around 1.5 - 2 hours to complete
* Nch’?ay? Viewpoint
* Shannon falls: 1 km easy hike
* Sea to Sky Gondola
* Howe Sound Brewing in squamish
